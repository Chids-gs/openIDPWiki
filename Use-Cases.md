IDP can be leveraged for different types scenarios and few of them are listed below.

## Accelerate Enterprise DevOps adoption
Enterprises typically face the following challenges that inhibit them from adopting DevOps smoothly.
-	Lack of tooling, scripting and integration skills
-	Isolated and inconsistent CI-CD orchestrations
-	Complex legacy systems and COTS products, whose processes are difficult to automate
-	Lack of visibility on adoption of practices

Being a centralized platform, IDP provides more than 150 ready to use pipelines for various technologies (including legacy and COTS products) and tools and saves significant effort by automating script generation and enhancing visibility through unified dashboard.


## Tools and process standardization and governance for reduced TCO
Diversity in tools and inconsistent processes are key factors for increased total cost of ownership in enterprises. IDP acts as a powerful instrument to streamline and standardize CI-CD tools by enforcing standard set of tools in DevOps pipelines. IDP also generates the orchestration pipelines and scripts, that are standardized w.r.t to application technologies and tools. Release Management and Environment Management features streamline the processes for release managers, environment and Ops managers and enhances handshake between the teams. 


## Selective CI-CD-CT onboarding
Multiple vendors/partners involved with an enterprise, often face difficulty implementing DevOps due to the scope of their work in the application lifecycle and limits to the access and environments. For instance, a partner could have access only to perform CI while deployment is handled by another partner and testing by another partner. IDPâ€™s services are modularized enough to be used depending on the scope of work. This could also be used in the way to gradually improve maturity in phased manner.
